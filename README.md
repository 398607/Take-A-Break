# Take-A-Break
by nagizero

A Windows Program that reminds user to take a break for every 30 minutes by notification, based on Qt.

Currently, it could already perform expectly and elegantly. Commitments are always welcomed.

For convenience

## To-do

-let user choose to "ok I will break" or "wait a minute and try to pull me up again". (new API of Windows10 needed?)

## Done

-let user could determine the breaktime instead of 30 minutes.
